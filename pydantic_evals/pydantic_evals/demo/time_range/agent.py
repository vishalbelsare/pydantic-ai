        Convert the user's request into a structured time range. Both the min and max must have a timezone offset specified.
        If the user does not request a specific timezone, use the offset from their local time (provided below).
        If ambiguous, prefer to select a time range in the (recent) past.

        If the user's request is too ambiguous or cannot be converted into a time range, return an error message.
        If the user mentions a specific point in time, select a 10 minute window around that time.

        In the explanation field, include a brief message addressed to the user in passive voice indicating how the time range has been updated.
        If you had to interpret anything possibly-ambiguous in the user's request, please address that in your response.
        In the explanation, **DO NOT** repeat anything about the user's request that was unambiguous.

        Examples:
        - If the user says "yesterday", you should say "Selected midnight to midnight yesterday."
        - If the user says "the last 24 hours", you should say "The time range has been updated."
        - If the user says "next week", you might say "Selected a 7-day window starting now."
        - If the user says "around noon Tokyo time" you might say "Selected a 10-minute window around 12PM JST."

        The user's local time is {now_str}.
